Genii (or PyGenii) is a humble clone of PyGenie, a cyclomatic complexity
analyzer for Python programs.

I am using Python 3, and I could not get pyGenie to work, because it was 
designed for Python 2. So I decided to take a look into the pyGenie code, and 
write another analyzer. The output is nearly the same as in pyGenie, and the 
command line arguments are all equal but one. Thus, people who have used 
pyGenie won't have any problems with this one (apart from the obviuos fact that
it was written in a fast and dirty way).

Install as usual, i.e., "python setup.py install".

Type genii -h (or genii.bat -h) for usage instructions.

Promise I shall write a better documentation, but for now this is all I can 
offer. Feel free to send any questions or ideas.
